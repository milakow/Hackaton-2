#Message generator

The following message generator was created during 2nd Hackaton with CODE:ME.
I chose this task because it can make my current job easier. 
One of my side responsibilities is to check and control if the company got back each signed contract. By using Excel and Python I could generate a messages to our subcontractors with details such as number of missing sign contracts and which orders do not relate to.
